# VRPSPD_solver

This simple GUI program allows you to solve VRPSPD problem with the use of heuristics method known as Clarke and Wright savings algorithm.

Yeah.. Ok.. But, but what exactly is VRP? What is heuristic? How does it even work? 


### VRP
The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?".

### VRPSPD
Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD): A number of goods need to be moved from certain pickup locations to other delivery locations. The goal is to find optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to visit the pickup and drop-off locations.

### Clarke and Wright savings algorithm
